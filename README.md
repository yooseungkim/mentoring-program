Final Goal :

#### How to launch program

1. set current working directory to `mentoring-program`

2. check if `g++` is installed by `g++ -v`

3. In the console, run `g++ ./*.cpp -o main` (Build)

4. In MacOS/Linux, run `./main`. In windows, run `main.exe`(Run)

(Or, in `./vscode/tasks.json`, add `.cpp` files in the `args` and run C/C++ file)


#### How to use Github 
1. `clone` the repository (e.g.`git clone https://github.com/yooseungkim/mentoring-program.git`) 
2. change to your `branch` (e.g. `git checkout changwan`) 
3. change the codes 
4. `commit` and `push` to your `branch` 
5. `pull request` to `merge` to the `main` 
6. Resolve some errors in `merge` stage
7. In your branch, `pull` the main branch (e.g. `git pull origin/main` (on your branch))
8. Then your branch has the same code with `main`
